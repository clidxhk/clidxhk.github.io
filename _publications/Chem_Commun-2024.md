**Abstract**

We present generalizing statistical surrogate models to select an optimized photosensitizer, TPP, which is subsequently loaded into autologous exosomes by ultrasonic mixing to achieve tumor targeting with enhanced therapeutic efficacy by photodynamic therapy (PDT). 
This work contributes to the exploration of PDT enhancement strategies, and provides new prospects for using autologous exosomes as a delivery system.
