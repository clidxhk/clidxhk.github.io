I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemistry at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the Southern University of Science and Technology. My recent research focuses on photochemistry and its applications in the biomedical field. My key interests lie in advanced imaging technologies, remote phototherapy, and excited-state molecules.

In my ongoing research, I am dedicated to leveraging data-driven molecular engineering to accelerate advancements in biomedicine while exploring the potential of artificial intelligence in chemistry and biomedical sciences.

My ultimate research goals are threefold:

+ To relentlessly pursue truth and push the boundaries of intellectual exploration.
+ To address real-world challenges and meet genuine human needs.
+ To connect the physical world, aiming to construct the ultimate "Gaia" planet.

My life motto is from **Confucius *The Analects*:** 

> **"To know what you know and to know what you do not know, that is true knowledge."**

> **“知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也”**
